## Leaves are reported to have an optimized behavior
<hr>

### They should act to maximize carbon gain, while minimizing costs

- Driven by resistances to CO<sub>2</sub> into leaves and then to the site of carboxylation
- Stomatal (g<sub>s</sub>) and mesophyll (g<sub>m</sub>) conductance both limit photosynthesis 

> - Limitations result from costs and tradeoffs
> - <strong>We know little about these relationships within canopies</strong>

> - <strong>Do light gradients define leaf properties</strong>
>   - Photosynthetic capacity (A<sub>max</sub>) and N should be <strong>↑</strong> in sun leaves

***=right

> - <strong>Is the whole canopy optimized to prevent water loss?</strong>
>   - Then   g<sub>s</sub> will be  proportional to photosynthesis across all leaves
>   - Intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> (C<sub>i</sub>) should not differ between sun and shade leaves 
 
> - <strong>What is the role of g<sub>m</sub> as its costs are less clear?</strong>
>   - If A<sub>max</sub> is <strong>↑</strong> in sun leaves then g<sub>m</sub> should be too
>   - Supply line of CO<sub>2</sub> to the site of carboxylation
